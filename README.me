### FlowSim
FlowSim is a program that helps users visualize laminar and turbulent flow in everyday objects, such as candles, faucets, and blenders. 
It has a variety of settings that users can tweak to see how the flow changes. 

NOTE: The G4P GUI Builder add-on and library must be downloaded for FlowSim to run! 
All files from this repository must be placed in a folder called flow-sim in order for the program to run!

Happy simulating!
